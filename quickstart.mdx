## Get Started with Your First Extension

Learn how to build your first extension and use it in Enconvo.



Step 1. Clone Extension Template from GitHub:


```bash bash
git clone git@github.com:Enconvo/Extension-Template.git
```

<Note>
 In the template repository, there are the following extension templates.
  - AI Template : Build an extension for interacting with LLM (Large Language Model) based on Langchain JS/TS. 
  - Prompt Template : Build an extension for using Prompt.
</Note>


Step 2. Go to the AI Template directory ( or the other extension directory ) and run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```

</CodeGroup>



Step 3. After successful installation then run the following command :

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Extension will be installed, you can now use it in Enconvo.
